# ENEMDU 2024
The 2024 National Survey of Employment, Unemployment, and Underemployment (ENEMDU), conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC), is a continuous quarterly survey that has been measuring Ecuador's labor market conditions since its inception in 1987. Its coverage is national, encompassing urban and rural areas across all provinces except Gal√°pagos, through in-person household interviews. The 2024 sample comprises 17,066 households (2,438 primary sampling units with 7 households each), collected quarterly in March, June, September, and December. The survey generates indicators on employment, unemployment, underemployment, income, working conditions, and sociodemographic characteristics, with statistical representativeness at the national level, by geographic area (urban/rural), five self-represented cities (Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca, Machala, Ambato), and other urban and rural domains.
